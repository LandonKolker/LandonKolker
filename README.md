## Hi there 👋

I'm an industrial engineer who's pivoting into data analytics and machine learning. After taking a 3-year break from work, I'm now diving into Python and data projects to rebuild my skills and move into a tech/data role.

🛠️ Right now, I’m working on a project analyzing semiconductor manufacturing data (using the SECOM dataset). It’s helping me get hands-on with real-world data and build confidence with tools like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

🎯 My goals:

Land a role in data analytics or data science

Build a portfolio that shows what I can do

Keep learning (and relearning!) Python, machine learning, and Git/GitHub

🧰 Tools I’m using and learning:
Python | Jupyter | VS Code | Git | pandas | matplotlib | scikit-learn

I’m here to learn, grow, and connect — always open to tips, feedback, or just saying hi!
